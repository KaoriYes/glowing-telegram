# Project Documentation: Enhancing Accessibility for Nicolette

## Week 1: Understanding User Needs and Initial Planning

During the initial week of the project, I observed Nicolette using her setup and interacting with prototypes developed by other students. Although I joined the project later, I gained valuable insights into Nicolette's challenges. Nicolette primarily uses a drawing tablet due to difficulties with fine hand motor skills, which affects her ability to navigate her laptop effectively. Noticing that Nicolette tested prototypes on a large screen rather than her own, I aimed to replicate her typical usage conditions for accurate testing.

One notable observation was that Nicolette's drawing tablet features four large buttons that remained unused. Recognizing the potential utility of these buttons despite her disability, I reckoned they could significantly improve her interaction with the laptop. While most prototypes created by classmates functioned adequately, they didn't address Nicolette's specific needs comprehensively. Thus, I began conceptualizing a Chrome extension with the aim of delivering a transformative solution tailored to Nicolette's requirements.

## Week 2: Prototype Development and Initial Testing

During the second week, I encountered challenges while developing the Chrome extension code. Despite these hurdles, I successfully programmed Nicolette's tablet buttons to execute essential functions. Observing Nicolette's positive reaction during testing was encouraging; she expressed satisfaction with the improved accessibility and convenience provided by the button functionalities.

The buttons on Nicolette's tablet were programmed to facilitate scrolling, copying, and pasting. Despite grappling with code intricacies, I received valuable guidance from peers and focused on refining the extension's functionality. Feedback from discussions with teachers highlighted key considerations regarding user interaction and interface design, such as ensuring clarity in text selection and copying/pasting processes. This feedback guided enhancements to the extension, aligning it more closely with Nicolette's usability requirements.

## Week 3: Finalizing the Extension and User Testing

By the third week, significant progress had been made in refining the extension's features and addressing technical issues through bug fixes. Testing sessions with Nicolette revealed her excitement and confirmed the effectiveness of the functionalities. The extension simplified text manipulation tasks, contributing to Nicolette's overall satisfaction and improved user experience.

However, a notable issue emerged during testing: Nicolette struggled to grasp the concept of text selection starting from a specific point within a word. Her difficulty stemmed from challenges with hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, leading to inadvertent omissions in selected text portions. Although time constraints prevented immediate adjustments, this observation underscores the importance of further refinement to accommodate Nicolette's unique interaction patterns.

## Wishlist for Future Enhancements:

Given additional time and resources, the following improvements and considerations would enhance the extension's utility and accessibility for Nicolette:

- **Refined Text Selection Mechanism:** Develop a more intuitive text selection method that accommodates Nicolette's challenges with fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Implement design updates to improve visual clarity and ease of use, ensuring seamless navigation for Nicolette.
- **Extended Testing and Feedback:** Conduct additional testing sessions with Nicolette to gather further insights and address any remaining usability concerns.
- **Accessibility Updates:** Introduce accessibility features to cater to Nicolette's specific needs, such as customizable button configurations and alternative input methods.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the project aimed to enhance accessibility for Nicolette by developing a customized Chrome extension tailored to her requirements. Through iterative development and user testing, significant strides were made in improving Nicolette's interaction with her laptop, particularly in text manipulation tasks. While challenges remain, the project highlights the potential for technology to empower individuals with disabilities and it was fun to think and work on creative ways to improve Nicolette her day to day experience.
